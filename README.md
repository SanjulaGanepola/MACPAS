# MACPAS
An android app to help patients in need who struggle with ALS using partner assisted scanning. On the press of a button, the app scans through sets of letters. After the assistant receives an indication from the ALS patient to select a button (ie. with the blink of an eye), the app then allows the patient to select the desired letter using the scanning method again. The purpose of this app is to draw on the manual aspects of partner assisted scanning but in the form of an app. The app also includes features such as text to speech and letter correction.
